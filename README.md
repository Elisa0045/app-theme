## General Info.

This project was made using the Visual Studio Core for writing the code, and then I use GitKraken for save my code remotely in Github.

Layout: I combine Flexboxgrid and CSS for have more efficient layouts, and works better for the development workflow.

For be more organized I create different branches that show every step and change that I made.

Everything was building in a really friendly web page, that everyone can understand and use.
